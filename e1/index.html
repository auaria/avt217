      <h1> Camellia's Q&#38A </h1>
        <p> And thus begins a series of questions I'm not ready to answer, but here I am anyway. </p>

<!-- Why are you looking at this!? It's a MESS!!! -->

      <ol>
      <h3> <li> <strong>Rae:</strong> What is a game you are currently playing or have recently finished? </li> </h3>
        <p> Since the quarentine I've been exclusively playing <em>FFXIV</em>. I'm on the Primal Dataserver, Ultros. Hit me up, I can help with most things.</p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Calvin:</strong> What is a big achievement that you achieved during quarantine or want to? </li> </h3>
        <p> As silly as it sounds, I'd like to make new friends. My social life has been nuked and I need help. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Me:</strong> Do you have good posture right now? </li> </h3>
        <p> Only when I'm reminded to. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Lina:</strong> Do you often question if the amount of clothes you buy a month is reasonable? </li> </h3>
        <p> I typically prefer a more classic style rather than trendy ones so my clothes don't actually get cycled very often.
          I will spend a ridiculous amount of money on a single article of clothing item that will last me a while though. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Robabeh:</strong> Which do you prefer if you like to eat meat: Hunting or Farming? </li> </h3>
        <p> While farming is most likely more economically stable and such, I usually find most sustinence hunters have a respect for nature and the animals they kill.
          Hunting for a sport and not eating the carcass is shameful though.  </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Gaby:</strong> What's the happiest moment in your life? </li> </h3>
        <p> I live moment to moment, thinking about the past usually leaves me trying for something that doesn't exist anymore.
          The only time I think ahead is about money and school. I'm fairly content right now though. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Josiah:</strong> What is your favorite book series? </li> </h3>
        <p> It has been a <strong>very</strong> long while since I've read a book series, however I remember enjoying the <em>Bartimaeus Sequence</em> a lot.</p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Shabreah:</strong> Did you drink water today and why not? </li> </h3>
        <p> Yes, I want to be pretty again. u-u) </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Asiya:</strong> what’s your favorite cartoon character? </li> </h3>
        <p> I really enjoy Winry from <em>FMA:B</em>, she's a good supporting character and I would like to help someone else like she does. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Michelle:</strong> Adidas or Nike? </li> </h3>
        <p> I almost exclusively wear high heels. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Sharon:</strong> If you could ask a question of anyone (living or dead), whom would you ask and what would the question be? </li> </h3>
        <p> My questions usually come at an "at need" basis, and right now - I only need coffee. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Madison:</strong> Have you ever created fan art, fanfiction, or remixed music from a piece of media you like? </li> </h3>
        <p> Plenty of times! I don't share my work online though and should learn how to use social media. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Wes:</strong> Disregarding money as a factor, what would your dream job be? </h3> </li>
        <p> Housewife. Despite my mother's best attempts to make me a "modern woman", my dad told me housewife is best wife and for some reason I still believe him. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Miranda:</strong> if you could change one thing from your culture, what would it be? </li> </h3>
        <p> Asians are notorious for being racists. The Vietnamese make it personal. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Noah:</strong> What do you do to unwind and cool down? </li> </h3>
        <p> Along with the standard listening to music, napping, and talking to friends - refer the question 1. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Tiffany:</strong> do you eat ketchup with your eggs? </li> </h3>
        <p> How are my eggs being made?  Answer that and then I'll say. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Yuxuan:</strong> Can you use an adjective or a sentence to describe what makes you different from other people？</li> </h3>
        <p> Smol, angy, stabby woman. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Maria:</strong> Whats a few things you have on your bucket list before moving on to the next life? </li> </h3>
        <p> Going on a vacation by myself. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Jordan:</strong> If you could be any animal, what would you be? </li> </h3>
        <p> Being a housecat and sleeping all day sounds pretty nice. </p>

      <h3> <li> <strong>Kai:</strong> What has the pandemic made you miss the most? </li> </h3>
        <p> I miss eating at cafés. </p>
